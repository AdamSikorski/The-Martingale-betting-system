# The Martingale betting system

## About the project
I made this project to make some simulations and check if the Martingale strategy really works.
	
## Technologies
Project is written fully in python. Code is stored in google colab notebook. <br />
You can preview the code with its output just by clicking on it on github.
	
## Setup
Code of the project is stored in **Martingale_system.ipynb** file.<br /><br />
You can run the project in 2 ways:<br />
1) Click on the **Martingale_system.ipynb** file and then on "Open in Colab". That will open the colab notebook where you can run the code.<br />
2) Copy and paste code from **Martingale_system.ipynb** file to any environment used in computer programming which allows you to program in python.
